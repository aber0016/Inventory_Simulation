# Inventory_Simulation
 
This repository contains an inventory simulation written in Python. The inventory simulation is split into two tasks, with task 2 containing adjustments for more specific simulation requirements. 

This program is an inventory management system for a company selling cantilever umbrellas. Task 1 will provide the user with the stock count and revenue at the end of a single year cycle of any given year from 2000 until 2040, while Task 2 will provide the user with the stock count and revenue of any time period between 2000 and 2040. Both programs read in a txt file containing information about the time period simulated and the starting inventory.


The program uses many Boolean variables in combination with loops and regular control flow mechanisms to check for the occurrence of certain conditions and adjust variables such as retail price and distributed quantity over time. For further details see the annotations in task 1 and 2.
